This project uses **Qiskit**, IBM's quantum computing SDK, to create a conceptual model of a digital market. It's not a literal simulation, but a powerful **analogy** that uses the principles of quantum mechanics to represent the complex, probabilistic, and interconnected nature of a competitive landscape.

The core idea is to frame a market analysis tool not as a simple data query, but as an act of **measurement** that collapses a "quantum-like" state of infinite market possibilities into a single, observable reality.

### The Analogy Explained

This script models a market with three main competitors, using a 3-qubit quantum circuit. The process mirrors the transition from market uncertainty to a concrete market snapshot.

#### 1. The Market in Superposition (`H` Gate)
-   **Quantum Concept:** A qubit can exist as both 0 and 1 simultaneously. The Hadamard (H) gate puts a qubit into an equal superposition of both states.
-   **Market Analogy:** Before we run our analysis, the market exists in a state of pure potential. All outcomes are possible. Is Competitor A strong or weak? Is Competitor C launching a new product? In this model, the market is in a superposition of **all 8 possible states at once**, representing total uncertainty.

#### 2. Competitors Are Entangled (`CX` Gate)
-   **Quantum Concept:** Entanglement is a phenomenon where the state of one qubit becomes intrinsically linked to the state of another, no matter the distance between them.
-   **Market Analogy:** Competitors are never independent. An aggressive ad campaign from one company directly affects the market share of another. We use Controlled-NOT (CNOT/CX) gates to **entangle** our competitor qubits, simulating these market influences and shifting the probabilities of certain outcomes.

#### 3. Analysis as Measurement (`Measure` Operation)
-   **Quantum Concept:** The act of measuring a qubit collapses its superposition into a definite classical state (either 0 or 1).
-   **Market Analogy:** Running our market intelligence application is an act of measurement. We take a "snapshot" of the market at a single point in time. This act forces the cloud of possibilities to collapse into **one single, observable reality**. The script simulates this measurement 1024 times to reveal the underlying probability distribution of the different market states.

X_Prize Quantum 
Initial Proposal Submitted to X Prize by Justin Houck on March 31st, 2025

Early, non-invasive Bovine Respiratory Disease (BRD) detection hinges on identifying biomarkers like specific volatile organic compounds (VOCs), but designing sensors requires accurately knowing their spectral signatures. Classical computational chemistry faces a critical bottleneck here: standard DFT often yields inaccurate excited state energies crucial for spectra, while high-fidelity methods scale exponentially, hindering reliable in silico screening of potential BRD biomarker candidates. Our project will demonstrate definitive quantum advantage by calculating key spectral properties specifically, low-lying electronic excitation energies and vibronic coupling constants for a targeted, high-potential BRD VOC biomarker. We employ a hybrid quantum-classical framework utilizing advanced variance-reduced Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) techniques and experimentally validated, multi-stage, hardware-aware error mitigation protocols optimized for excited state calculations on near-term quantum hardware. Compact, chemically-optimal ansätze will be generated adaptively. Our primary goal is achieving spectroscopic accuracy (<0.1 eV error) for the target electronic transitions, surpassing documented classical limitations. This quantum result will be validated via an exhaustive, pre-registered, open-data benchmarking protocol against state-of-the-art classical methods (multiple DFT functionals, EOM-CCSD(T), DMRG/CASPT2). Quantum advantage will be rigorously proven by demonstrating superior accuracy within defined computational resource budgets. The core XPRIZE deliverable is the validated, high-accuracy spectral calculation for the target BRD biomarker, accompanied by the complete benchmark dataset and analysis proving quantum advantage. This provides the first reliable prediction of these spectral features, directly enabling sensor design for early BRD detection. It's a landmark demonstration of quantum computation solving an intractable spectroscopy problem with high-value application in animal health and food security, fulfilling the XPRIZE goal with verified capability. 
Quantum Simulation (Chemistry-focused) 
Description: Uses quantum computers to calculate the properties of molecules and chemical reactions by simulating their underlying quantum mechanical electronic structure. Algorithms like VQE (Variational Quantum Eigensolver) and its advanced variants (e.g., ADAPT-VQE) are employed to find molecular energy levels. Proposed Use Cases: Calculating reaction barriers for catalysts (Nitrogen Fixation - SDG 2, 9, 12, 13), predicting molecular spectra for biomarkers (BRD Detection - SDG 2, 3, 9, 12), calculating drug-target binding energies (BRD Therapeutics - SDG 2, 3). 
Quantum Simulation (Physics/Dynamics-focused): 
○ Description: Uses quantum algorithms to model the time evolution or properties of physical systems (other than molecular electronic structure), such as fluid dynamics or field theories. Methods might include quantum walk models, QLBM-inspired approaches, or potentially algorithms for simple field theories. 
○ Proposed Use Cases: Simulating complex barn atmospheric conditions (airflow, particle transport) for foundational BRD understanding (SDG 2, 3, 12, 15). Quantum Machine Learning (QML):
○ Description: Leverages quantum computing principles potentially to enhance machine learning tasks. This includes algorithms like Quantum Kernel Methods, Quantum Neural Networks, or variational quantum classifiers designed to find complex patterns or correlations in data, potentially more efficiently or effectively than classical ML for certain problems. 
○ Proposed Use Cases: Analyzing high-dimensional sensor/biometric data to find predictive signatures of BRD risk (SDG 2, 3, 12). 
Quantum Optimization: 
○ Description: Uses quantum algorithms (like QAOA - Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm, or potentially Quantum Annealing) to find approximate or exact solutions to complex optimization problems, often combinatorial in nature (e.g., finding the best configuration out of many possibilities). 
○ Proposed Use Cases: Optimizing operational schedules (e.g., ventilation systems) or resource allocation strategies in farms for better BRD management and efficiency (SDG 2, 3, 9, 12).
