This project uses **Qiskit**, IBM's quantum computing SDK, to create a conceptual model of a digital market. It's not a literal simulation, but a powerful **analogy** that uses the principles of quantum mechanics to represent the complex, probabilistic, and interconnected nature of a competitive landscape.

The core idea is to frame a market analysis tool not as a simple data query, but as an act of **measurement** that collapses a "quantum-like" state of infinite market possibilities into a single, observable reality.

### The Analogy Explained

This script models a market with three main competitors, using a 3-qubit quantum circuit. The process mirrors the transition from market uncertainty to a concrete market snapshot.

#### 1. The Market in Superposition (`H` Gate)
-   **Quantum Concept:** A qubit can exist as both 0 and 1 simultaneously. The Hadamard (H) gate puts a qubit into an equal superposition of both states.
-   **Market Analogy:** Before we run our analysis, the market exists in a state of pure potential. All outcomes are possible. Is Competitor A strong or weak? Is Competitor C launching a new product? In this model, the market is in a superposition of **all 8 possible states at once**, representing total uncertainty.

#### 2. Competitors Are Entangled (`CX` Gate)
-   **Quantum Concept:** Entanglement is a phenomenon where the state of one qubit becomes intrinsically linked to the state of another, no matter the distance between them.
-   **Market Analogy:** Competitors are never independent. An aggressive ad campaign from one company directly affects the market share of another. We use Controlled-NOT (CNOT/CX) gates to **entangle** our competitor qubits, simulating these market influences and shifting the probabilities of certain outcomes.

#### 3. Analysis as Measurement (`Measure` Operation)
-   **Quantum Concept:** The act of measuring a qubit collapses its superposition into a definite classical state (either 0 or 1).
-   **Market Analogy:** Running our market intelligence application is an act of measurement. We take a "snapshot" of the market at a single point in time. This act forces the cloud of possibilities to collapse into **one single, observable reality**. The script simulates this measurement 1024 times to reveal the underlying probability distribution of the different market states.

X_Prize Quantum 
Initial Proposal Submitted to X Prize by Justin Houck on March 31st, 2025

Early, non-invasive Bovine Respiratory Disease (BRD) detection hinges on identifying biomarkers like specific volatile compounds (VCs), but designing sensors requires accurately knowing their spectral signatures. Classical computational chemistry faces a critical bottleneck here: standard DFT often yields inaccurate excited state energies crucial for spectra, while high-fidelity methods scale exponentially, hindering reliable in silico screening of potential BRD biomarker candidates.  Our project will demonstrate definitive quantum advantage by calculating key spectral properties specifically, low-lying electronic excitation energies and vibronic coupling constants for a targeted, high-potential BRD VOC biomarker. We employ a hybrid quantum-classical framework utilizing advanced variance-reduced Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) techniques and experimentally validated, multi-stage, hardware-aware error mitigation protocols optimized for excited state calculations on near-term quantum hardware. Compact, chemically-optimal ansätze will be generated adaptively.  Our primary goal is achieving spectroscopic accuracy (<0.1 eV error) for the target electronic transitions, surpassing documented classical limitations. This quantum result will be validated via an exhaustive, pre-registered, open-data benchmarking protocol against state-of-the-art classical methods (multiple DFT functionals, EOM-CCSD(T), DMRG/CASPT2). Quantum advantage will be rigorously proven by demonstrating superior accuracy within defined computational resource budgets.  The core XPRIZE deliverable is the validated, high-accuracy spectral calculation for the target BRD biomarker, accompanied by the complete benchmark dataset and analysis proving quantum advantage. This provides the first reliable prediction of these spectral features, directly enabling sensor design for early BRD detection. It's a landmark demonstration of quantum computation solving an intractable spectroscopy problem with high-value application in animal health and food security, fulfilling the XPRIZE goal with verified capability.

1. College of Veterinary Medicine & Biomedical Sciences (Vet School):
Veterinary Pathobiology / Infectious Disease Specialists:
Role: Crucial for identifying the most promising candidate VOC biomarkers for BRD. They understand the disease process, the specific pathogens involved (viral and bacterial), and the host immune response. They likely have knowledge of existing (or emerging) research on metabolites and VOCs associated with different stages or types of BRD.
Needed Expertise: Deep knowledge of BRD etiology and pathophysiology, understanding of host-pathogen interactions, familiarity with current BRD diagnostics and their limitations, potential knowledge of metabolomics/volatilomics research related to bovine diseases.
Large Animal Clinical Sciences / Food Animal Medicine Specialists:
Role: Provide clinical context. They understand how BRD presents in the field, the challenges of early detection, the practicalities of sample collection (even non-invasive like breath), and the real-world significance of detecting specific biomarkers. They can help validate the clinical relevance of the chosen target VOC.
Needed Expertise: Clinical diagnosis of BRD, herd health management, understanding of disease progression in individual animals and populations, practical farm/feedlot conditions.
Veterinary Physiology and Pharmacology:
Role: Understand the physiological basis for VOC production. How does the animal's metabolism change during BRD to produce the specific target VOC? What are potential confounding factors (diet, stress, other diseases) that might affect the VOC profile?
Needed Expertise: Bovine physiology, metabolism, respiratory physiology, understanding of how disease states alter metabolic pathways.
2. Department of Animal Science (Often collaborating closely with AgriLife Research):
Animal Physiology / Metabolism Specialists:
Role: Similar to Vet Physiology, but potentially with a greater focus on production aspects. They understand baseline metabolic profiles, how factors like nutrition, genetics, age, and stress influence physiology and potentially VOC output. This helps contextualize the biomarker signal against background biological "noise."

Beef Cattle Production Specialists (Often part of AgriLife Extension/Research):
Role: Provide the production system context. They understand the economic impact of BRD, current management strategies, limitations of current detection in large-scale operations, and the practical requirements for any future sensor technology (e.g., robustness, cost-effectiveness, ease of use). They help frame the value proposition of the project's outcome.
Needed Expertise: Feedlot management, cow-calf operations, livestock economics, practical application of technology on farms/ranches.
3. Texas A&M AgriLife Research / Extension:

The key is accessing researchers actively working on BRD, animal health monitoring, or related areas like precision livestock farming. Expertise needed would mirror those listed above (Pathobiology, Physiology, Production).
AgriLife Extension Specialists (particularly Livestock/Beef):
Role: Bridge the gap between research and producers. They can help assess the real-world applicability and potential impact of a sensor based on the accurately characterized VOC signature. They understand the decision-making process of producers regarding adopting new technologies.
